        According to the data of dental Bookimed partner clinics located in
        Mexico, the average cost of veneers is $250 per 1 veneer. Depending on a
        clinic, veneer type, and the doctorâ€™s qualification, the price may
        reduce or increase. Note that the average cost for a veneer in the USA
        is about $950 per tooth. So, even with travel expenses, it is more
        profitable to visit Mexico to install veneers instead of doing the same
        procedure in the USA.
