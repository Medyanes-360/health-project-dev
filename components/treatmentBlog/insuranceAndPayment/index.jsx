            Health insurance does not cover such dental services as veneer
            installation because this procedure is performed for esthetic
            purposes. So you will cover all expenses on your own. That is why
            getting veneers in foreign countries makes things more accessible
            and affordable. You can use credit cards and cash for services
            payment.
