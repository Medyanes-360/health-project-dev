            What Is the Average Price for Veneers in Mexican Clinics?

            According to the data of dental Bookimed partner clinics located in
            Mexico, the average cost of veneers is $250 per veneer. Depending on
            the clinic, veneer type, and the doctorâ€™s qualifications, the price
            may vary. Note that the average cost for a veneer in the USA is
            about $950 per tooth. So, even with travel expenses, it is more
            profitable to visit Mexico for veneer installation instead of doing
            the same procedure in the USA.
